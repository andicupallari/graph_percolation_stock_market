# graph_percolation_stock_market

I use graph and percolation theory to model a group of market participants and the market breakdown after a critical mass of the participants decide to leave the market. I do not distinguish between buyers or sellers, i.e. I assume the decision of the market participant to buy or cell is not modelled but can be endogenous or exogenous.

Next, I simulate the connectivity of different graph types including random graphs and ER graphs. After a critical value of the number of links added between nodes, a giant component emerges. This can be seen in all types of graphs.
